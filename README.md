# Customer Sales Analysis
In this project, I explore a sales dataset to generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I start by analyzing sales revenue and then move on to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique.

I work on a range of skills in this project, including:

-Importing a file into a SQL Server Database

-Using SQL aggregate functions

-Using SQL window functions

-Working with sub queries in SQL

-Using common table expressions (CTEs)

-Working with the SQL XML Path function

This project was a great way to practice and improve your skills in SQL, particularly when it comes to working with complex queries and data manipulation.
